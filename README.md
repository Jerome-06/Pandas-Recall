 About Me
Hi, I'm Jerome R — an aspiring Data Scientist / Analyst passionate about turning raw data into meaningful insights.
This repository documents my hands-on journey learning pandas, one of the most powerful Python libraries for data analysis. Every script here was written, tested, and understood by me — not just copied.
---
Why This Project?
As a fresher stepping into the data world, I believe the best way to learn is by writing real code. This repo covers the complete pandas workflow — from loading data to cleaning it — the same workflow used by data professionals every day.

 What I Learned & Built
#	Topic	What I Practiced	File
1	Series	Creating labeled 1D data, loc/iloc indexing, boolean filtering	`series.py`
2	DataFrame	Building tables, adding columns, filtering rows, concat	`dataframe.py`
3	Importing Data	Reading CSV & JSON files into DataFrames	`importing.py`
4	Selection	Selecting rows/columns by label, handling missing keys	`selection.py`
5	Filtering	Boolean masks, AND/OR conditions on real datasets	`filtering.py`
6	Aggregation	mean, sum, min, max, groupby — summarizing datasets	`aggregation.py`
7	Data Cleaning	Handling nulls, removing duplicates, fixing data types	`cleaning.py`
---
 Key Concepts I Understand
`loc` vs `iloc` — label-based vs position-based indexing
Boolean masking — the core of pandas filtering
`groupby()` — splitting data into groups for analysis
`pd.to_numeric(errors='coerce')` — safely converting messy data
Data cleaning pipeline — drop → fill → replace → standardize → deduplicate
---
🔍 Code Highlights
Filtering students with score ≥ 75 AND age > 20:
```python
result = df[(df["Score"] >= 75) & (df["Age"] > 20)]
```
Grouping by department and finding average score:
```python
group = df.groupby("Department")
print(group["Score"].mean())
```
Full data cleaning pipeline:
```python
df["Department"] = df["Department"].replace({"Mech": "Mechanical"})
df["Department"] = df["Department"].str.lower()
df["Score"] = pd.to_numeric(df["Score"], errors="coerce")
df = df.drop_duplicates()
```
